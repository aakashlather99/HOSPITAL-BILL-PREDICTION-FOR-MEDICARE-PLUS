Project Introduction: Hospital Bill Prediction for MediCarePlus

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict hospital bills for MediCarePlus patients. The goal is to leverage historical patient data to build a predictive tool that can estimate the cost of hospitalization based on various factors.

The dataset used in this project includes information such as patient demographics (gender, age), insurance type, diagnosis, the number of procedures and medications, whether surgery was performed or ICU admission was required, the length of hospital stay, and the type of room occupied.

By analyzing the relationships between these features and the final hospital bill amount, the machine learning model aims to provide accurate cost predictions. This can be valuable for various applications, including financial planning for both patients and the healthcare provider, optimizing resource allocation, and potentially identifying factors that significantly influence hospital costs. This is a regression problem, as the model is predicting a continuous numerical value (the hospital bill amount).
